# EncoderDecoderTPC
I stopped working on it, I just can't make an fast and efficient compression, for a 3840*2160 pixels pictures it runned for half an hour without any results ,and the code is not even at, let's say 10% of progression. So yep, i'm done with this !!!

At least I could use it later for bit reading/writing.

CHECK DEV BRANCH TO SEE CODE I AM WORKING ON
